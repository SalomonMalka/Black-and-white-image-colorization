## The final results


## Project goal and Motivation

The problem of colorizing an image is very interesting and was not possible to do in automatically before machine learning was introduced.
One of the biggest challenges in this problem is finding a loss function that

Our goal was Using different types of loss functions to find out which one works better for this task.

## Previous work
We used an article about building Colorization algorithm as our base line for the project. 
Most of the sources we found use GAN architecture for their model, because it is capable of creating a loss function that estimate how “real” the image look, instead of more simple pixel to pixel loss functions.

## Loss functions


## Further development ideas

1. Training with bigger dataset and on more epochs
2. Try different perceptual loss functions to see if training times can be shorter.
