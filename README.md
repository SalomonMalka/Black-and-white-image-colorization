## Project goal and Motivation

The problem of colorizing an image is very interesting and was not possible to do in automatically before machine learning was introduced.
One of the biggest challenges in this problem is finding a loss function that

Our goal was Using different types of loss functions to find out which one works better for this task.

## Previous work
We used an article about building Colorization algorithm as our base line for the project. 
Most of the sources we found use GAN architecture for their model, because it is capable of creating a loss function that estimate how “real” the image look, instead of more simple pixel to pixel loss functions.

## Loss functions


## Further development ideas

1. Try to expand our work to more facial expression datasets.
2. Try different uses of the attention mechanism.

|Google Colab| Render, view, edit and save the notebooks to Google Drive (limited time) |


Jupyter Nbviewer:

[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taldatech/ee046211-deep-learning/main/assets/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis/tree/master/)


Press on the "Open in Colab" button below to use Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis)

Or press on the "launch binder" button below to launch in Binder:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis/master)

Note: creating the Binder instance takes about ~5-10 minutes, so be patient

### Running Locally

Press "Download ZIP" under the green button `Clone or download` or use `git` to clone the repository using the 
following command: `git clone https://github.com/taldatech/ee046211-deep-learning.git` (in cmd/PowerShell in Windows or in the Terminal in Linux/Mac)

Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook (it is recommended to use Anaconda). Installation instructions can be found in `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`.


## Installation Instructions

For the complete guide, with step-by-step images, please consult `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`

1. Get Anaconda with Python 3, follow the instructions according to your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) at: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Install the basic packages using the provided `environment.yml` file by running: `conda env create -f environment.yml` which will create a new conda environment named `deep_learn`. If you did this, you will only need to install PyTorch, see the table below.
3. Alternatively, you can create a new environment for the course and install packages from scratch:
In Windows open `Anaconda Prompt` from the start menu, in Mac/Linux open the terminal and run `conda create --name deep_learn`. Full guide at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands
4. To activate the environment, open the terminal (or `Anaconda Prompt` in Windows) and run `conda activate deep_learn`
5. Install the required libraries according to the table below (to search for a specific library and the corresponding command you can also look at https://anaconda.org/)
